# 15 Minutes Over Notifier

Back when I was in college and having a tough time being disciplined through exam times, I used to write down / send an update about what I studied in last 15 minutes. So, even if I had spent the time wasting it on facebook, every 15 minutes I used to hear a bell telling me that I've already wasted last 15 minutes on facebook.

This is the code for that. It's simple. It just plays the audio.mp3 file in this repo every 15 minutes, infinitely. And, it does help. Give it a try! :)
